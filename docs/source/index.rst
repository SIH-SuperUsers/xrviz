XrViz
=====

*An interactive visualisation interface for Xarrays*

XrViz is an interactive, in browser visualisation interface for Xarrays backed
by the full power of the Python ecosystem. It allows controlled data points
selection, massive rendering, data display, custom interaction and selection
of fields for plotting in the browser using `Xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org>`_
and `HoloViz <http://holoviz.org/>`_ collection of tools.

It helps Earth Science and other researchers to directly focus on exploring
data and visual data investigation and analysis, rather than writing custom
code, thus saving significant amounts of time. It also facilitates interactive
browsing of the increasingly large collection of gridded data in the cloud,
which is also strongly beneficial for the users.
